        Over the past decade, I’ve worked across consumer products, B2B
        platforms, and <br /> agentic AI systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently lead design and frontend at Origon, where I work on
        AI-native software used in real operational environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        My focus is on long-lived systems—interfaces that scale in complexity
        without losing clarity, and frontend architectures built to hold up over
        time. I prefer owning problems end to end, from early product definition
        to shipped code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside full-time work, I collaborate with a small number of teams on
        selective freelance projects.

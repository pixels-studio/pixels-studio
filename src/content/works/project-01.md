ElevenLabs uses AI to generate remarkably lifelike, versatile and contextually-aware speech, voices, and sound effects across 32 languages. It is this quality, nuance, and diversity of audio outputs that set their technology apart in a highly competitive field.

To clarify these capabilities, we created a brand identity based on abstract, variable elements called Voice Signatures and Sound Flows, which morph to represent the many types and qualities of our AI audio.

As a hybrid organization, ElevenLabs conducts AI audio research to develop foundational models and deploys B2B and B2C products built on those models. As the technology advances, new tools and features are rapidly released.

To support this pace of growth, we introduced a flexible structure for the company’s research and products that clarifies their core offering for businesses and creators, while leaving space for their first consumer application.
